# IPT2018-WEEKLY-REPORT


Through the first week, I was able to understand the  general meaning of what is machine learning, that is technique of finding solution or getting insights about complex problems and large amount of data and types of classification of machine learning.

Also till the end of week one I was able to use different python libraries like pandas, numpy,matplotlib and scikit learn.

Then after understanding the different libraries I learnt and understood the three models of classification in machine learning which are, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors(KNN) and Random Forest.

After studying and understanding all these we were assigned a week 1 challenge task to determine continue and drop students as a group. The challenge made me improve my skills in the use of Logistic Regression and K Nearest Neighbors(KNN). 

Generally I am now familiar with python for data science and its libraries like numpy, matplotlib , pandas and scikit . Also the three models Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors(KNN) and Random Forest. Lastly I am now capable to remove null entries in dataset , do feature engineering ,convert object data type, predict scores and fit data to my model.

Other.
I was able to learn about confusion matrix and precision recall curve. How to use the true negative, true positive, false negatives and false negative to determine the precision and recall in order to calculate the f1 score.

Task, I need to understand more on imbalanced data/classes.
